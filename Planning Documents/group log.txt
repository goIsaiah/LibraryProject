- The team decides on writing an sql file that takes care of initializing the database rather than doing so using JDBC. 
- Abbey completes ratings and reviews of the books, and merged her branch to the main branch. 
- Vince completes gui for forum, but still requires to connection to the main gui as well write more tests. 
- Jet completes logic for switching between Book databse and retrieving data from API as needed by the app. 
- Isiah completes registration and log in logic and gui. Only thing left is to connect to the new database. 
- Sathira fixes bugs and possibly implementing citation if group decides it is needed. 

The citation component is not included at this time because other user stories are at 
higher priority such as searching, checking out, comments/forum , and ratings and reviews. 
The team also has to do more integration and stub testing before the end of iteration 2. 

Next meeting: 09/03/2023 
Present: Everyone
- The team meets and works on testing appropriate classes as well as integration testing.
- The team irons out final details and prepares for submission on Friday.
