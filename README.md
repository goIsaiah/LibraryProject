## What is BookMate?

BookMate is a library system and social media hybrid app that is focused on students and book lovers alike. 
Similar to an actual library website, users can see what books are available to borrow, place holds, and check the status 
of the books theyâ€™ve checked out or placed holds on.  BookMate's social media component allows users to rate and review books to build their profile, and interact with other BookMates.
